# man_pages

recreating [man7.org](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html) using only HTML (as of 02 December 2022)
#

## Prerequisites/ Dependencies

Any Browser
#

## Reason for doing this

1. HTML assignment in my college with a 13 days deadline.
2. I always wanted to do a man page site. I might maybe even add JS to automatically create webpages using given data.
